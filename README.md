# SE1FA15-Project

This was my submission which was handed in the last term of my first year as the coursework for the Fundamentals and Applications of Computing module. The brief that was supplied is also included. A summary of assignment is below :


> Implement a program in C++ that sorts a list of floating-point objects. Numbers should be sorted in increasing numerical order. Say how minus zero and Not-a-Number (NaN) objects are to be sorted.


Other languages were allowed, so i chose a language that i was more familar with at the time (Visual Basic)
The report is also attached. The source code may vary slightly from the screenshots in the report.

**My mark for this assignment was 95%
